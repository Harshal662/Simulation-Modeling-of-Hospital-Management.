# Simulation-Modeling-of-Hospital-Management.

Project is made in Simio Software.

It has 2 models -

Model 1 - The current health care system consist of any other normal hospital system where there are various activities going on simultaneously. Patients are coming through the source, registration for the respective treatment, taking the treatment, billing and exiting the hospital. 

Model 2 - Now since we observed overcrowding at registration counter and billing, we thought of a new system where we can introduce one dedicated billing counter specifically for emergency and vaccine takers so that crowding is reduced in main counter and we can have streamlined flow of patients in the hospital. 

Observations-

1. By implementing model 2, we can substantially decrease the crowding on registration counter. 

2. People who are coming in for vaccination do not have to stay for a long time as we have created a dedicated billing counter for them.
